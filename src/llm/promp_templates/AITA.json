    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AITA for refusing to let my sister borrow my car for her spontaneous road trips? I (29F) have a small, reliable car that I worked really hard to buy and maintain. My sister (23F) recently started getting into these random weekend getaways with her friends, and she’s been asking to use my car because hers is old and constantly breaks down. The problem is, she’s not the most responsible person, and I worry about insurance, gas money, and the wear and tear she’ll put on it. She got annoyed when I said “no” last weekend, claiming I’m being selfish and not supporting her desire to “see the world.” But the truth is, I’m just trying to protect my investment and avoid extra costs. Now my parents are hinting that I should be more generous, and my sister is acting distant and sulky. Am I really obligated to hand over my car just because we’re family? I don’t think I’m in the wrong for wanting to keep my property safe, but maybe I’m being too rigid. AITA? "},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AITA for asking my roommates to keep their shoes out of the living room? I (24M) live in a shared apartment with two other guys who seem to have no problem leaving their sneakers, boots, and even muddy cleats scattered around the sofa area. I grew up in a household where shoes came off at the door, and the idea of lounging around with dirty footwear nearby grosses me out. I’ve mentioned it politely a few times, but they just laugh it off and say I’m being overly uptight. The place ends up smelling like old socks, and I feel like I’m living in a dorm, not a clean adult space.They argue it’s their space, too, and that I shouldn’t force my standards on them. But I’m not asking for something crazy—just a bit of respect for shared areas. Am I crossing a line by trying to get them to adopt a “shoes off at the door” policy, or should I just suck it up? AITA?

    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AITA for telling my coworker to stop calling me by a nickname I hate? I (32F) started a new job a month ago, and one of my coworkers, “Jim” (40M), insists on calling me “Maddie” even though my name is Madeleine. I’ve never gone by Maddie, and I’ve told him nicely that I prefer my full name. He just laughs and says “Maddie” suits me better. Now it’s getting to the point where I feel disrespected because he’s ignoring my simple request. I finally snapped and told him to knock it off in front of a few other coworkers, which made him sulk and claim I’m overly sensitive.Some of my other colleagues say I could have handled it more privately. I feel like I did try the polite route, but he wouldn’t listen. Now I wonder if I should have just let it go. Am I making too big a deal out of a nickname, or is it fair to want people to call me by my actual name? AITA?  "},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AITA for not inviting my entire extended family to my wedding? I (28F) am getting married next summer and my fiancé (30M) and I want a small, intimate ceremony. We decided on a guest list of about 50 people, just immediate family and a few close friends. However, my mother is furious that I’m not including my second cousins, great-uncles, and people I haven’t seen since I was ten. She believes a wedding is about bringing the whole clan together, but I see it as a day for me and my future husband to celebrate with those who truly matter to us now.The problem is that my extended family is used to massive weddings, and I’m worried they’ll feel snubbed. But the more people we add, the less personal (and more expensive) it becomes. Am I being selfish for wanting to keep it small and meaningful, or should I give in to family pressure? AITA? "},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "AITA for telling my best friend I’m not comfortable being her unpaid therapist? My best friend (26F) has been going through a tough time with her job and relationship. I’ve tried to be there for her, listening patiently, offering advice, and even checking in daily. But lately, it’s starting to feel like every interaction is a dumping ground for her problems. I gently suggested that she might benefit from talking to a professional or joining a support group, as I’m feeling emotionally drained. She got upset, saying I’m supposed to be her support system and that I’m abandoning her in her time of need. I care about her deeply, but I also have my own mental health to consider. Is it wrong to set boundaries and encourage her to seek help from someone trained to handle this stuff, or am I being a bad friend by not continually providing emotional labor for free? AITA? "}

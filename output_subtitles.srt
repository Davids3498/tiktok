1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,333
AITA for telling my best friend I’m not comfortable being

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,666
her unpaid therapist? My best friend, 26F, has been going

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:10,000
through a tough time with her job and relationship. I’ve

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,333
tried to be there for her, listening patiently, offering advice,

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,666
and even checking in daily. But lately, it’s starting to

6
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,000
feel like every interaction is a dumping ground for her

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,333
problems. I’d gently suggested that she might benefit from talking

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,666
to a professional or joining a support group. As I’m

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:30,000
feeling emotionally drained, she got upset, saying I’m

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,057
supposed to be her support system and that I’m abandoning

11
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:36,114
her in her time of need. I care about her

12
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:39,171
deeply, but I’m also have my own mental health to

13
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:42,228
consider. Is it wrong to set boundaries and encourage her

14
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:45,285
to seek help from someone trained to handle this stuff,

15
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,342
or am I being a bad friend by not continually

16
00:00:48,342 --> 00:00:51,400
providing emotional labor for free? AITA?
